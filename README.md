# Planavator
Geomhacks Hackathon Project with Vince, Allan, Grace and June

Planavator is a web-application designed to organize your day to day schedules while maintaining social distancing protocols. By combining user inputs and Google maps data, the Planavator creates a schedule that allows users to visit the public spaces they need to go such as supermarkets, doctor's office and pharmacies at times during the day when the fewest customers are at those locations.
